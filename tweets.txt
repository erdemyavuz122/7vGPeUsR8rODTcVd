"Rule #11: URL parameters are a scam"

From this great article: https://alexkrupp.typepad.com/sensemaking/2021/06/django-for-startup-founders-a-better-software-architecture-for-saas-startups-and-consumer-apps.html#rule15

For GET and DELETE actions, use only query parameters. 

For POST and PUT actions, use only request body data. And never use URL parameters. Tweet dizisi
Django for Startup Founders: A better software architecture for SaaS startups and consumer apps
